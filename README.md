- 👋 Hi, I’m @M4lucard AKA Wout
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity and specifically OT and Hardware/IoT Security
- 🌱 I’m currently going through the IEC62443 certification and I am constantly looking at improving my knowledge in the field of OT, ICS and IoT.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in my knowledge domain and interest range, and that are in general just fun and engaging
- I am also a huge Dungeons & Dragons nerd, so some of my private repos are just filled with notes and campaign ideas
